v0.3
identify security flaws in current code

v0.4
script now installs ubuntu/solarcoin-qt automatically from a bootable encrypted USB

the goal is to make installing a hardware wallet something the average person can do,
so all that needs to happen is: (1) hand them a hard drive, and (2) instructions on how to boot

auto:
1) install ubuntu
2) sudo enable ufw (figure out the best config for this based on what will be on the image)
3) turn off ipv6
3) add vpn tunnel
2) encrypt entire hard disk
3) check memory
4) check hard disk for errors
5) if memory/HD errors exist, user is informed/asked if they would like to proceed
6) connect to HWG cloud for backups, sets weekly/daily/hourly schedule based on user preference
7) complete all omitted tasks the current script (v0.2) does
